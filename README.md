WordProof Timestamp Plugin for WordPress

## Welcome to the WordProof Timestamp GitHub repository

While the documentation for the [WordProof Timestamp plugin](https://wordproof.io/guide) can be found on [WordProof.io](https://wordproof.io), here
you can browse the source of the project, find and discuss open issues and even
contribute yourself.

## Security issues

* add as much information as possible. For example: add screenshots, relevant links, step by step guides etc.

## I have a feature request
Before opening a new issue, please:
* search for duplicate issues to prevent opening a duplicate feature request. If there is already an open existing request, please leave a comment there.
* add as much information as possible. For example: give us a clear explanation of why you think the feature request is something we should consider for the WordProof Timestamp plugins.

## I want to create a patch
Community made patches, localizations, bug reports and contributions are very welcome and help WordProof remain the #1 blockchain timestamp plugin for WordPress.

## Chains we support

| Host                    | Chain Id                                                         |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| eos.greymass.com        | aca376f206b8fc25a6ed44dbdc66547c36c6c33e3a119ffbeaef943642f0e906 |
| api.telosgermany.io     | 4667b205c6838ef70ff7988f6e8257e8be0e1284a2f59699054a018f743b1d11 |
| api.jungle.alohaeos.com | e70aaab8997e1dfce58fbfac80cbbb8fecec7b99cf982a9444273cbc64c41473 |

The three networks listed above are all different blockchains, running the EOS.IO software. The first entry is the EOS mainnet, Telos is an independent mainnet (https://www.telosfoundation.io/) and Alohaeos Jungle is an EOS testnet.

Right now, there is no good way of knowing which host is the most reliable. We are using Greymass as it performed good consistently these past months, but there are many more. For Telos we are using the foundation's endpoint and the Jungle endpoint is from it's founder.

Currently, we are not supporting blockchains apart from these three. While supporting other EOS.IO chains is a relative minor task, adding other blockchains running different software will require a lot more work to be done. Nevertheless, we are exploring the possibilities.
